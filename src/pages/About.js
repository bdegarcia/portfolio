        <p>I am currently a part of a team that services cars, but I am currently figuring out how less tangible things work under the hood!</p>
        <p>In my free time, my girlfriend and I have spent the past 2 years making an old house I bought more like a home.</p>
        <p>My parents own a small livestock farm, and I also enjoy helping them move cows and hunt for chicken eggs.</p>
        <p>There has never been a better time to learn how to code. Normally, I like to spend as much time as possible outside of the house, but due to current events, I have plenty of free time to spend in front of the computer.</p>
        <p>When I am not working in this class, helping on the farm, or avoiding a globl pandemic, I love being the uncle that spoils my 2 nephews any way I can.</p>
